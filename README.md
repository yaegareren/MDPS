# Multiple Disease Prediction System

![Disease Prediction](prediction-image.png)

The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning project that can predict test results for heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes. It utilizes the logistic regression algorithm to make accurate predictions. The model has been efficiently trained with ample train data and has also been tested using test data. The users need to enter the data according to the fields specified for each test.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Disease Prediction**: Predict test results for heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Utilize the logistic regression algorithm for accurate predictions.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Users can easily enter data based on specified fields for each test.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Pickle

## Usage

1. On the homepage of the application, you will find options to select the disease test you want to predict: heart disease, Parkinson's disease, or diabetes.

2. For each disease, there will be specified fields to enter the required data.

3. Enter the necessary data as prompted and click the **[Disease]Test Result** button.

4. The system will process the data using the logistic regression model and provide the predicted test results.

5. You can repeat the process for different diseases and explore the accuracy of the predictions.

## Model Training and Testing

The logistic regression model used in the Multiple Disease Prediction System has been trained using a diverse and ample dataset specific to each disease. The dataset was preprocessed, and feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant features. The model was trained using suitable hyperparameters and cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness.

The trained model was then tested using separate test data to evaluate its performance and accuracy. The dataset was picked from Kaggle.
